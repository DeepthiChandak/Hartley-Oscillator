# Hartley Oscillator
Generating AC output from DC input using Hartley Oscillator.
The Hartley Oscillator design uses two inductive coils in series with a parallel capacitor to form its resonance tank circuit producing sinusoidal oscillations.
It is used to produce sinusoids of the desired frequency.
